**Geospatial Data Quality Metrics with Streamlit**

Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize geospatial data quality metrics and user satisfaction using Streamlit. It simulates geospatial data quality and user interaction metrics, creates new evaluation metrics, and visualizes the results through interactive charts. Users can adjust input parameters to see how different factors influence data quality and user satisfaction.

Features
Dynamic Data Simulation: Simulates geospatial data quality and user satisfaction based on user-defined parameters.
Metric Calculation: Calculates new metrics to evaluate data quality and user satisfaction.
Visualizations: Provides interactive charts including histograms and scatter plots to explore data distributions and relationships.
User Input: Allows users to adjust the number of samples and noise levels to see real-time updates in metrics and visualizations.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
streamlit
